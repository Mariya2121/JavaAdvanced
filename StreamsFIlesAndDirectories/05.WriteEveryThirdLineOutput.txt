                                    (_J. A. Symonds_.)          Is lone as some volcanic isle;        For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate."        For thee, against myself I'll vow debate,       Are mine alone."       The flowers and fruits of love are gone,       _A funeral pile_"     An armed knight's captive and slave confessed."     And almost thence my nature is subdu'd     And haply of our old acquaintance tell.     And made myself a motley to the view;     And so should you, to love things nothing worth."     And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love."     As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,     As the _death-bed_ whereon it must expire,     As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report."     Askance and strangely; but, by all above,     Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang."     Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue     But do not so; I love thee in such sort,     But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought,     Clasp in these yearning arms and keep for aye     Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by."     Even to thy pure and most most loving breast."     Exceeded by the height of happier men."     Fixed be that moment on the dial of heaven!     Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,     I have no precious time at all to spend,     I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;     Lest I (too much profane) should do it wrong,     Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame:     Let time stand still, and let noon's chariot stay;     Made old offences of affections new:     Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth     My heart's loved lord to me desertless given."[ 5 ]     No marvel if alone and bare I go     No torch is kindled at its blaze--     Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,     Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,     Nor services to do, till you require.     Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,     Nor thou with public kindness honour me,     Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted,     Oh blessed day when you at last are mine!     Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,     Save, where you are how happy you make those."     That I may clasp and keep, by grace divine--     That on the ashes of his youth doth lie     That thou, in losing me, shalt win much glory."     The flames of holy worship, nor denies     The grace reserved for those who humbly sue.     The worm, the canker and the grief     These blenches gave my heart another youth,     Thy sweet-beloved name no more shall dwell,     To set a form upon desired change,     To what it works in, like the dyer's hand."     Unless thou take that honour from thy name:     Upon the hours and times of your desire?     Upon those boughs which shake against the cold     Upon thy part I can set down a story     When _yellow leaves_, or none, or few, do hang     When you have bid your servant once adieu;     Where you may be, or your affairs suppose;     Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,     Your spirit sees into my heart, where rise    "Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,    "And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,    "Being _your slave_, what should I do but tend    "For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,    "I may not evermore acknowledge thee,    "If only chains and bands can make me blest,    "In me thou seest _the glowing of such fire_    "More tenderly perchance than is my due,    "My days are in _the yellow leaf_,[ 6 ]    "So are you to my thoughts as food to life."    "That time of year thou mayst in me behold    "Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,    "Thence comes it that my name receives a brand;    "Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,    "With mine own weakness being best acquainted,    "_The fire that on my bosom preys_    (_J.
